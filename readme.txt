Weekly Coding Challenge:
Pls mention the link to your solution in the comments section not later than Friday morning.

1) Magic Index: A magic index in an array A [ 0 ... n -1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. 
Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.

Follow up: What if the values are not distinct?

2) Power Set: Write a method to return all subsets of a set.

3) Recursive Multiply: Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the *operator. 
You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.
